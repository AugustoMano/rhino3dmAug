# Publishing new versions

## JavaScript

### Node.js

1. Build rhino3dm.js and rhino3dm.wasm
1. Build and run docgen (for type definitions)
2. Create a new directory and copy in rhino3dm.js, rhino3dm.wasm and rhino3dm.d.ts
3. Copy rhino3dm.module.js from the previous release (see note 2)
4. Copy in RHINO3DM.JS.md and rename to README.md
5. Update the version number in package.json and copy that in too
6. From inside the new directory, run `npm publish` (see note 3)

See https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages for more info.

#### Notes:
1. After creating a user on npm.org, ask Will to add you to the mcneel team!
2. This is generated by compiling the project with `EXPORT_ES6=1` and takes a long time for a small change to the js wrapper
3. If publishing a pre-release, e.g. `0.4.0-dev`, use `npm publish --tag next` ([source](https://medium.com/@mbostock/prereleases-and-npm-e778fc5e2420))
